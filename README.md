# Windshields/Glass break detection with TinyML Syntiant

## The challenge

There are several challenges that must be overcome when designing a sound-event detection system: glass-breaking sounds are usually faint and can be easily masked by background noises, they can be similar to other sounds, such as a car backfiring or something being dropped on the ground and these sounds can be short and acute, so the system must be able to detect them quickly and reliably.

## The solution

Our approach to this problem is to create an IoT system based on the TinyML Syntiant development board that will run a machine learning model trained using the Edge Impulse platform that can detect the sound of breaking glass and notify the owner of the car via SMS when this event is detected.

## Conclusion

This project is a great example of how IoT and Machine Learning can be used together to create a powerful security system. So far, we have been able to successfully train and deploy a machine learning algorithm that can detect the sound of breaking glass. We are continuing to work on improving the accuracy of the detection and on reducing false alarms. We are confident that with further development, this system can become a valuable tool for preventing car theft.
